//! Time control: slow motion through the slow-motion manager's normal game speed, and a hold on
//! the engine clock.
//!
//! The clock's own `m_UpdateSpeed` is not the knob: `CSlowMotionManager::Update` rewrites it every
//! frame from `s_NormalGameSpeed` blended with any active effect, so a write there lasts one frame.
//! Writing the normal speed instead persists and keeps the game's scripted slow-motion effects
//! (the near-miss, the death camera) blending against the directed rate rather than fighting it.
